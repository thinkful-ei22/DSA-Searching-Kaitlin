// Find a Book
// Imagine you are looking for a book in a library with a Dewey Decimal index. How would you go about it? Can you express this process as a searching algorithm?
// 10 categories with sub categories

// A binary search would be good for searching through this collection of books based on how they are organized. With a binary search, you could eliminate categories first and then eliminate the sub categories until you found the correct one that houses the book you're looking for.
